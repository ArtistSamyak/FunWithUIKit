🎉 I've just released a new open-source package that brings the convenience and functionality of SwiftUI's ZStack to UIKit. As iOS developers, we often juggle between SwiftUI and UIKit. While SwiftUI offers the powerful ZStack view, UIKit requires more effort to achieve similar layouts. Not anymore!

🛠️ Introducing My Custom ZStack for UIKit: This package allows you to overlay views on top of each other with ease, just like you would in SwiftUI. It's designed to be simple to use, yet flexible enough for various UI designs.

🌟 Features:

📐 Easy integration into existing UIKit projects.
🎨 Customize offsets for each subview, giving you creative freedom to design intricate layouts.
🔧 Auto Layout support for dynamic and responsive designs.

🔗 Explore and Contribute:
The package is open-source, and I warmly welcome contributions, feedback, or any form of collaboration. Check it out here and let's make UIKit development even more robust and enjoyable: FunWithUIKit on GitHub

👨‍💻 Your Input Matters:
As this is a community-driven project, I'm keen to hear your thoughts, suggestions, and experiences. Let's discuss how we can further enhance UIKit's capabilities together!
